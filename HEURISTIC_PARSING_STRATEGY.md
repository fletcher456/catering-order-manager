# Heuristic Parsing Strategy: Exploiting Fractal Self-Similarity in Menu PDFs

## Executive Summary

This document presents an engineering strategy for enhanced menu item triple extraction (name/description/price) using structural consistency analysis and fractal self-similarity patterns. The approach leverages the inherent regularity of professionally designed menus to create robust parsing algorithms that distinguish between different data types and validate extraction accuracy through cross-referencing.

## Core Engineering Principles

### 1. Fractal Self-Similarity Exploitation
Professional menus exhibit fractal properties where similar structures repeat at different scales:
- **Macro Level**: Page layouts, section divisions, category groupings
- **Meso Level**: Menu item blocks, spacing patterns, typography hierarchies  
- **Micro Level**: Name/description/price arrangements, alignment systems, font choices

### 2. Structural Consistency Analysis
Elements of the same type (names, descriptions, prices) maintain consistent characteristics:
- **Typography**: Font family, size, weight, style consistency within element types
- **Spatial**: Positioning patterns, alignment grids, margin/padding uniformity
- **Content**: Length distributions, character patterns, formatting conventions

### 3. Cross-Validation Through Pattern Recognition
Multiple validation layers ensure accurate classification:
- **Intra-type Validation**: Elements match patterns of their assigned type
- **Inter-type Discrimination**: Clear distinctions between names, descriptions, prices
- **Document-wide Consistency**: Patterns hold across entire document structure

## Heuristic Classification Framework

### Names Heuristics
```
PRIMARY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Length: Typically 1-6 words, rarely exceeding 50 characters
- Position: Usually topmost or leftmost in triple arrangement
- Typography: Often bold, larger font, or distinct styling
- Content: Descriptive nouns, minimal punctuation, title case common
- Uniqueness: Should be unique within menu scope (fuzzy matching for variations)

VALIDATION RULES:
- Length(name) ≤ Length(description) OR Length(name) ≈ Length(description)
- Font weight often > description font weight
- Capitalization patterns consistent across names
- No decimal currency patterns (distinguishes from prices)
```

### Descriptions Heuristics
```
PRIMARY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Length: Typically 3-25 words, 20-200 characters
- Position: Middle or below name in vertical arrangements
- Typography: Regular weight, smaller than names, detailed formatting
- Content: Descriptive phrases, ingredients, preparation methods
- Punctuation: Commas, periods, parentheses common

VALIDATION RULES:
- Length(description) ≥ Length(name) in 80%+ of cases
- Contains descriptive keywords (served, made, topped, fresh, etc.)
- More complex sentence structure than names
- May contain ingredient lists or preparation details
```

### Prices Heuristics
```
PRIMARY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Pattern: Currency symbols ($, €, £) + decimal numbers
- Length: Typically 3-8 characters ($X.XX format)
- Position: Rightmost or bottom in triple arrangements
- Typography: Often distinct alignment (right-aligned)
- Range: Document-wide price distribution analysis

VALIDATION RULES:
- Matches currency regex patterns: ^\$?\d+\.?\d{0,2}$
- Numerical values within reasonable restaurant pricing range
- Distribution analysis: prices should form coherent economic clusters
- Distinguished from other numbers (calories, sizes, item numbers)
```

### Number Classification System
```
PRICE INDICATORS:
- Currency symbols present
- Decimal precision (typically 2 digits)
- Economic clustering (similar price ranges)
- Positional consistency (right-aligned patterns)

NON-PRICE NUMBERS:
- Piece counts: Small integers (1-20), no decimals, no currency
- Calorie counts: Large integers (100-2000), often with "cal" suffix
- Item numbers: Sequential integers, often prefixed (#, No.)
- Measurements: Followed by units (oz, lb, ", ', inch, foot)
- Serving sizes: Small numbers with "serves" or "portions"
- Like counts: Social media patterns (rare in restaurant menus)
```

## Cross-Page Region Analysis

### Contiguous Region Detection
```
ALGORITHM: Cross-Page Boundary Analysis
1. Identify incomplete regions at page bottom edges
2. Search corresponding top edges of subsequent pages
3. Calculate spatial alignment and typography consistency
4. Merge regions if:
   - Horizontal alignment matches (±10px tolerance)
   - Typography characteristics consistent
   - Content flow logical (name→description→price)
   - Combined region forms valid triple structure
```

### Page Boundary Heuristics
```
DETECTION CRITERIA:
- Incomplete price at page bottom + price completion at page top
- Description text cutoff with continuation patterns
- Consistent spacing and alignment across page boundaries
- Typography matching (font, size, weight continuity)

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Combined region confidence > individual region confidences
- Spatial relationships maintained across page break
- Content semantically coherent when merged
```

## Fractal Self-Similarity Algorithm

### Pseudo-Code Implementation
```
ALGORITHM: Fractal Structure Reconstruction
INPUT: PDF pages with extracted text elements and coordinates
OUTPUT: Validated menu item triples with confidence scores

1. MACRO ANALYSIS (Document Level)
   FOR each page:
     - Identify recurring layout patterns
     - Map typography hierarchies
     - Detect section boundaries and category divisions
     - Build document-wide consistency models

2. PATTERN TEMPLATE EXTRACTION
   - Analyze first 3-5 successfully identified triples
   - Extract spatial relationships (name→description→price positioning)
   - Build typography fingerprints for each element type
   - Create alignment and spacing templates

3. FRACTAL PROPAGATION
   FOR each unprocessed region:
     - Apply extracted templates to identify similar structures
     - Calculate similarity scores against established patterns
     - Validate using cross-referencing heuristics
     - Adjust templates based on successful matches

4. STRUCTURAL CONSISTENCY VALIDATION
   - Verify name uniqueness across document scope
   - Validate price distribution and economic clustering
   - Check typography consistency within element types
   - Cross-validate spatial relationships

5. CROSS-PAGE BOUNDARY PROCESSING
   FOR each page transition:
     - Identify incomplete regions at boundaries
     - Search for completion patterns on adjacent pages
     - Apply contiguous region merging algorithm
     - Validate merged regions against established patterns

6. CONFIDENCE SCORING AND REFINEMENT
   - Calculate composite confidence scores
   - Filter low-confidence extractions
   - Apply document-wide consistency checks
   - Generate visual validation markers

CONFIDENCE METRICS:
- Pattern Similarity Score: 0.0-1.0 (match to established templates)
- Typography Consistency: 0.0-1.0 (font/size/weight alignment)
- Spatial Relationship Score: 0.0-1.0 (positioning pattern match)
- Content Validation Score: 0.0-1.0 (heuristic rule compliance)
- Cross-Reference Validation: 0.0-1.0 (document-wide consistency)

FINAL CONFIDENCE = weighted_average(all_metrics) * region_quality_modifier
```

## Conclusion

This heuristic parsing strategy leverages the inherent fractal self-similarity of professional menu designs to create robust, self-validating extraction algorithms.

The fractal approach recognizes that menus are carefully designed documents with consistent internal logic, allowing us to learn patterns from high-confidence regions and propagate them throughout the document. This creates a self-reinforcing parsing system that improves accuracy through structural consistency validation.
