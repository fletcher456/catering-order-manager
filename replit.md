# Project Documentation

## Overview

A React-based catering order management system that parses restaurant menu PDFs and generates quantity-based orders with guest count calculations. The application runs entirely in the browser, making it perfect for static hosting on GitHub Pages.

## System Architecture

### Frontend-Only Architecture
- **React 18**: Modern UI framework with hooks for state management
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development environment
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework

### Client-Side Processing
- **PDF.js**: Mozilla's PDF parsing library for client-side PDF text extraction
- **Browser APIs**: File API for uploads, Canvas API for PDF rendering
- **Local Storage**: No server-side data persistence required

## Key Components

### Core Application Components
- **App.tsx**: Main application component with state management for workflow
- **PDFUploader**: Handles PDF file uploads and parsing using PDF.js
- **CateringOrderForm**: Interactive form for guest count and quantity selection
- **OrderSummary**: Final order display with export capabilities

### Utility Modules
- **pdfParser.ts**: PDF text extraction and menu item parsing logic
- **types.ts**: TypeScript interfaces for MenuItem, CateringOrder, OrderItem

### UI Components
- Drag-and-drop file upload with visual feedback
- Quantity sliders with recommended values based on guest count
- Real-time cost calculations and category organization
- Export options (download, print, email)

## Data Flow

### PDF Processing Workflow
1. **Upload**: User selects PDF file via drag-drop or file picker
2. **Parse**: PDF.js extracts text content from all pages
3. **Extract**: Custom parser identifies menu items, prices, and descriptions
4. **Categorize**: Smart categorization based on keywords (Appetizers, Mains, etc.)
5. **Display**: Organized menu items presented to user

### Order Generation Flow
1. **Guest Count**: User sets number of guests
2. **Recommendations**: System calculates suggested quantities per item
3. **Customization**: User adjusts quantities using interactive controls
4. **Calculation**: Real-time total cost and per-guest cost updates
5. **Export**: Generate downloadable/printable order summary

## Recent Issues Resolved

### GitHub Actions Build Fix
- **Issue**: GitHub Actions failing with "Missing script: build" error
- **Root Cause**: package.json missing build script, cannot be modified due to environment restrictions
- **Solution**: Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to use direct Vite commands:
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` for type checking
  - `npx vite build --base ./` for production build with correct GitHub Pages base path
- **Status**: ✓ Resolved - deployment workflow now functional

### CSS Styling Issues on GitHub Pages
- **Issue**: Tailwind CSS not loading properly on static hosting
- **Root Cause**: PostCSS processing conflicts with static deployment
- **Solution**: Created standalone CSS file (`src/app.css`) with complete utility classes
- **Status**: ✓ Resolved - styling now works reliably on GitHub Pages

### PDF Parsing Debugging Enhancement
- **Issue**: PDF parsing getting stuck without clear error information
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive real-time logging system:
  - Step-by-step progress tracking in PDF parser
  - Live log display in upload component UI
  - Detailed error reporting with specific failure points
- **Status**: ✓ Implemented - logs now show exactly where parsing fails

### PDF.js Worker Loading Issue
- **Issue**: PDF parsing stuck at "Loading PDF document..." due to CDN worker loading failures
- **Root Cause**: PDF.js worker failing to load from external CDN sources on GitHub Pages
- **Solution**: Configured local PDF.js worker bundle:
  - Copied `pdf.worker.min.js` to public directory for local serving
