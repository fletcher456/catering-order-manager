# User Interaction Layer Documentation

## Overview

The User Interaction Layer provides the primary interface between users and the PDF menu parsing system. It handles file upload, validation, progress feedback, and results display with emphasis on transparency and user control throughout the parsing process.

## Components

### PDF Upload Interface

**Purpose**: Accept PDF files through drag-and-drop or file picker interface

**Design Principles**:
- Progressive enhancement with fallback support
- Visual feedback for drag states and file acceptance
- Clear error messaging for invalid files

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Support for drag-and-drop with visual indicators
- File picker fallback for accessibility
- Immediate file type validation
- Size limit enforcement (configurable, default 50MB)
- Multiple file selection disabled to focus processing

**File Validation Rules**:
1. Must be valid PDF format (MIME type and magic number validation)
2. Size constraints to prevent browser memory issues
3. Not password-protected or encrypted
4. Contains extractable text content (not purely image-based)

### Progress Display System

**Purpose**: Provide real-time feedback during PDF processing phases

**Design Principles**:
- Transparency in processing steps
- Clear indication of current phase
- Estimated time remaining when possible
- Graceful handling of processing delays

**Progress Phases**:
1. **File Loading**: PDF parsing and initialization
2. **Text Extraction**: Page-by-page content extraction
3. **Heuristic Analysis**: Number classification and typography fingerprinting
4. **Spatial Clustering**: Region detection and confidence scoring
5. **Menu Item Assembly**: Triple parsing and validation
6. **Bootstrapping**: Fallback processing if needed (conditional)
7. **Final Validation**: Deduplication and quality assurance

**Technical Implementation**:
- Callback-based logging system from parser
- Real-time DOM updates without blocking UI
- Error state handling with recovery options
- Detailed log preservation for debugging

### Results Display Interface

**Purpose**: Present extracted menu items with visual validation and confidence metrics

**Display Components**:

#### Menu Items List
- Hierarchical organization by category
- Individual item cards showing name, description, price
- Confidence scores displayed as percentage badges
- Category-based color coding for visual organization

#### Visual Validation Thumbnails
- Embedded PDF region images (32x20 pixel thumbnails)
- Expandable view for detailed region inspection
- Confidence score overlay on thumbnails
- Coordinate information for debugging

#### Quality Metrics Dashboard
- Overall extraction success rate
- Category distribution statistics
- Price range analysis
- Typography consistency metrics

**Interaction Design**:
- Expandable/collapsible sections for large menus
- Search and filter capabilities
- Sort by confidence, price, or alphabetical order
- Export options preparation for catering interface

## Error Handling Strategy

### User-Facing Error Messages

**File Validation Errors**:
- "Please select a valid PDF file"
- "File size exceeds limit (50MB max)"
- "PDF appears to be password protected"

**Processing Errors**:
- "Unable to extract text from PDF - may be image-based"
- "PDF format not supported"
- "Processing interrupted - please try again"

**Recovery Options**:
- Clear retry mechanism with same file
- Option to try different file
- Contact support with error details

### Graceful Degradation

When parsing yields poor results:
1. Display whatever items were successfully extracted
2. Show confidence scores to indicate quality
3. Offer manual entry option for missing items
4. Provide export of partial results

## Accessibility Considerations

### Keyboard Navigation
- Full keyboard accessibility for file upload
- Tab navigation through results
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### Screen Reader Support
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for dynamic content
- Alternative text for visual elements
- Status announcements for progress updates

### Visual Design
- High contrast color schemes
- Scalable text and interface elements
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Colorblind-friendly category coding

## Performance Considerations

### Client-Side Processing
- Non-blocking UI updates during processing
- Efficient DOM manipulation for large result sets
- Memory management for PDF processing
- Progress indication to manage user expectations

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-optimized upload interface
- Tablet-friendly results display
- Desktop-focused detailed analysis view
- Adaptive layout for various screen sizes

## Integration Points

### PDF Processing Pipeline
- Seamless handoff to PDF loader
- Callback registration for progress updates
- Error propagation from processing layers

### Catering Interface
- Menu item data transfer
- State preservation between views
- User preference persistence

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- Batch processing for multiple PDFs
- User feedback collection for improving parsing
- Manual correction interface for extracted items
- Template saving for restaurant chains

### Analytics Integration
- Usage pattern tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- User satisfaction feedback

## Technical Specifications

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers with ES2020+ support
- PDF.js compatibility requirements
- Canvas API support for region extraction
- File API support for upload handling

### Memory Management
- Large PDF handling strategies
- Garbage collection optimization
- Progress indication for memory-intensive operations
- Fallback processing for resource constraints
